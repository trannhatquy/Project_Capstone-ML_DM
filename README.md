Basic Image Captioning Model with Pytorch Lightning using CNN and LSTM

This repository show how to apply neural network (CNN, LSTM) using pytorch lightning to generate a caption from a given image. The dataset we use is Flickr8k Image Caption dataset. The model contains encoder to encode the image into a latent vector and then use that vector in the decoder for generate text.
